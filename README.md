# BlackagarBotagon
This project is a Discord bot capable of playing the audio of YouTube videos. He's named after the Marvel character whose ability is based on his voice, because I think that's funny.

# Motivation
Music bots are a staple of Discord servers. However, YouTube doesn't like that the popular bots are used to make money. Because of this, most bots end up either shutting down or removing the ability to play YouTube vides, and that's lame. So I made this bot that I can host locally and not have these issues.

# Features
This bot features most of the functionalities of traditional music bots. You can search for songs by keywords, play a song from a URL, or play a playlist of songs from a URL. You can pause, resume, and skip songs. You can check the queue of songs.
